* intro - recap collatz conjecture
- explain collatz's motivations from dynamical systems book

* animate a bunch of different trajectories, superimposed
- looks like chaos
* animate the number line all at once, so we can see polynomials
- but there is some structure here
- we'll come back to this

* talk about findings / what a proof would look like

** solution paper templates
*** undecidable + proof
**** conway
*** true + proof
**** plenty of broken proofs (even published, according to wirsching ch 1)
*** false:
**** cycle exists:  how it was found
**** infinite chain: proof that it's infinite

** quick quotes about it being too hard

** what we do know
*** mention the two books
*** recent work by tao (40 pages) and the sat guy
*** 3n-1 has a cycle
*** cycle length is related to its lowest number
*** computer verified up to 2^n

* TODO transition from verifiers -> counterexamples

** ???
- nonetheless, a solution eludes us
- possibly because it's uncediable or because it's not true
- how to look for a counterexample?
- verifiers might stumble on to one, but can we try anything else?


** verified is ~ 2^68 = show a 8 x 8 grid with 2 extra pixels.
- linear vs exponential scale

** and yet think about how long it would take to search that space
- how big is 2^68 if you did it manually?
- you don't do the whole chain, because you can remember earlier results
- but even just counting to 2^68 would take a long time
- so you have to prune

** pruning : minimal criminals
- only search for the lowest number in a cycle
- if it drops below the start, it's wrong
- note: it doesn't have to be the lowest cycle, just the lowest in the cycle
- for a verifier, you can get a stronger result by going sequentially:
  everything below 'n' is known to go to 0
- but if you're just fishing around with really huge numbers, maybe they're more common.

** now we can cut out numbers mod k
- briefly show binary / mod-k stuff?
- or just skip over this?

** introduce the polynomial tree
- cut back to the line-splitting visualization
- demonstrate that everything starts at y=x
- make that the root node
- divide by two means it's under the line, so it can't be minimal criminal
- doing 3x+1 is allowed

* higher order polynomials
** explain polynomials in j

* what it means to be on or under y=x after so many steps
it's not strictly "under" unless they're parallel.
so you find the intercept.
if the intercept is n, and you know everything <= n goes to 1, prune.

* note that the intersection with y=x is special and may reveal a loop!

* does parallel to y=x mean an infinite sequence?
- it's not a cycle because the numbers go /up/.
- only if a number that follows that path is transformed into another number that also follows that path
- in other words, the increase in the y-incercept would have to be a whole
  number k such that n and n+k followed the same path in the polynomial tree
- (i think this means k would have to be a power of two, since the useful equivalence classes are x mod (power of two))
- <could it also be more complicated and cycle between more than one equivalence class?>

* anyway, now we have our tree, and we can prune it

* verifiers walk this tree breadth first

* what if we were to look for a counterexample?
- walk depth first, pruning and backtracking if necessary until we find a viable branch, and then we descend.

* the cycle length theorem
- a cycle of length k will have integer interepcts with y=x on row k of tree
- cycles length k = very big
- so they'll be spread out across a line
- but even though k is big, the row in the tree is 2^k

* what happens when we prune?
- we pruned a whole lot of that in the rows above k
- however, the pruned branches contain parts of the cycle
- we'll never follow branch that is pruned
- so only the minimal criminal(s) remain
- but what if there are many of them?
- even if there is only one more cycle, pruning makes the target "bigger"
- if many cycles exist, we might find one
- even though extremely rare, they become half as rare at each step
- number line is infinite but we keep discarding the half where they can't be
- (does that argument hold water? infinity is weird)

* maybe demonstrate that we can find the extra cycle for 3n-1?
* if you want to try it for yourself...
* thanks' for watching
