#+title: how to be a cartoon: lip syncing

* tooning
Anyone can be a cartoon.
You just have to believe in yourself!

* motivation (live video)
- hard to record one shot
- so video tends to have lots of jump cuts

* is it feasible?
basic problem: match pictures to phonemes
but how to get phonemes?
forced alignment: when you know the text beforehand
(of course you have to know that a given series of letters might be two different words "project")
rotoscoping?
video capture?

* how lipsync works
- papagayo
- rhubarb
  - optional mouth shapes

* pixel art
- changing grid sizes (or just using bigger brushes)

* layers for the rig
- shoulders
- head
- mouth
- eyes
- eyebrows and forehead
- (arms and legs if you want)
- export layers at full size just so everything lines up

* godot
