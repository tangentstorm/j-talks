#+title: reading j (sandpiles code review)

* quick reframe
- was going to do line by line code review
- can easily spend 15 minutes talking about one line in depth
- instead, focus on reading j with a couple examples


* sandpiles code golf
** my version
#+begin_src j
load'viewmat'

f=:_1 1|.!.0"0 _]
s=:(++/@(_4&*,f,f&.(|:"2))@(3&<))^:_

viewmat s 50 50$4
#+end_src

*** (parse f)
f is just some function. probably could have named it v for verb. :)

: ] right identity.
: 0 _ noun but then " makes it part of rank
:    two args so this is probably a dyad
: then 0 another noun, which goes with !.
: !. is a generic modifier it means different things depending on the verb.
: |. is the main verb it means rotate
: but with !. means fill with 0 instead of wrapping
: then the "0 _ makes it apply to each left arg and all of right arg

so this winds up making two copies of y:
one shifted backwards, one shifted forwards.
since y is rank 2 array in our case, that means shifted up and down.

*** (parse s)
: (v)^:_ just means repeat until it stops changing
  (so it's possible to create an infinite loop)

: (3&<) just means greater than 3

: @ composes that with the next verb

: next verb: everything in parens
:   (|:"2), &., f form one verb
:   comma
:   f
:   comma
:   _4&* is just multiplication

: @ compose with +/

: +

** jitwit's version
#+begin_src j
s=:(+[:(_4&*+[:+/((,-)(,:|.)0 1)|.!.0])3&<)^:_
#+end_src

: same power conjunction
: v =: +[:(_4&*+[:+/((,-)(,:|.)0 1)|.!.0])3&<
: s =: v^:_


: u =: (_4&*+[:+/((,-)(,:|.)0 1)|.!.0])
: v =: + [: u 3&<
: s =: v^:_


: x =: (,-)(,:|.)0 1
: u =: _4&* + [: +/ x |.!.0 ]
: v =: + [: u 3&<
: s =: v^:_


** even smaller:
#+begin_src j
j=:(+[:(_4&*+[:+/((,-)(,:|.)0 1)|.!.0])3&<)^:_  NB. from jitwit
j=:(+[:(_4&*+[:+/(((,.|.)0,i:1)|.!.0])3&<)^:_   NB. better shifts
j=:(+[:+/_4*((,.|.)0,i:1) |.!.0 3&<)^:_   NB. fork
#+end_src
