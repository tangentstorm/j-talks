#+title: Blender As A Video Editor

* VSE comes at the end of the pipeline

* Compositing /can/ be done in the VSE, but the UI is lacking.

* Why blender then, instead of kdenlive/openshot/etc?
Python scripting.

* we can overlay a scene in the vse

* what prevents vse from being an input to compositor?
- there's no such input node

- is it possible to read the timeline from the vse
  and use it to control the frame in an image sequence?

- there's apparently a PyNode.

* chromakey

* what's the fastest way to set up chromakey for the current video?
** option a: instead of editing raw video, could i edit the composite scene?
- answer: yes! and this seems like the right way to do it!
- then the filename would only be in the compositor.
- apply compositing to the raw, unedited footage

** option b: separate blender file that imports the edited footage
- create a rectangular mask in upper left corner
  (could just be a static image in illustrator)
- insert a key mask node


* python switch scene


* greenscreen notes
motion tracking tab
create object and give it a name
ctrl-click to append a bunch of trackers
add keying screen object
