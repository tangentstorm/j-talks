* gridpad
#+begin_src j
NB. gridpad: a simple sprite editor

#+end_src

Today we're going to build this little sprite editor in J.

It's a pretty rudimentary as far as graphics programs go
but you can load and save files,
draw in different colors with the mouse,
and customize your palette as you go.

More importantly, we'll cover everything you need to know to make
interactive programs that respond to the mouse and keyboard.

So let's get started.

* cleanup
#+begin_src j
clear''                                   NB. erase all definitions.

gpw_close =: verb define                  NB. when 'gpw' close button clicked
  wd'psel gpw; pclose; timer 0'
)

gpw_close^:(wdisparent'gpw')''            NB. close old window each time we run.

#+end_src

One of the first things I do when I start writing a gui program in J
is to write the close handler for my window, and then invoke
it to clean up any old versions of the window.

It's mostly just handy while you're developing, otherwise
you have to manually close the old one
each time you make a change and re-run your script.

Here my window is named gpw for gridpad window,
so =gpw_close= is automatically called if I click this close button.

It doesn't actually close the window unless you tell it to.
That's so you can put an "are you sure" message up, or save state, or whatever.
In this case, I just select the window, close it,
and then turn off the system timer.

Then the bottom line calls that verb, but only if the window exists.
The way it works is that wdisparent returns a 0 or 1
depending on whether or not the window exists,
and then the power conjunction uses that number
to decide how many times to recursively call the function.
Calling a function zero times is a no-op,
which means the power conjunction also doubles as a conditional.

Right now we do have a running window named gpw,
so if I run this code, it'll close that window.

I should explain that I'm doing something new this video.
This window right here is a little presentation tool I
made that's also running in J.

I've got a button I can press to run whatever code is on the slide.
I'm hoping it's going to still feel like a live coding session,
but without all the typos.

Maybe I'll talk about how it works in another video, but for now,
let me know in the comments what you think of this format, and
in the meantime, I'm just going to press the button and run this code.

...

Okay. So the window disappeared.
and this line at the top erased all the old code that was running,
so now the only word we have defined is this close handler.

So let's get started building our simple sprite editor in J!

* window setup
#+begin_src j
wd 'pc gpw closebutton; minwh 640 500'    NB. create window 'gpw'
wd 'pn "gridpad: simple sprite editor"'   NB. add title
wd 'bin v'                                NB. vertical bin
wd '  bin h'                              NB.   horizontal bin
wd '    cc pal isigraph;setwh pal 25 400' NB.     narrow isigraph for palette
wd '    set pal sizepolicy fixed fixed'   NB.     keep palette from resizing
wd '    cc img isidraw;setwh img 480 480' NB.     square isidraw canvas
wd '  bin z'                              NB.   /bin
wd '  cc sb statusbar'                    NB.   status bar
wd '  set sb addlabel text'               NB.   ... with status text
wd 'bin z'                                NB. /bin
wd 'pmove 40 480 0 0; ptop; pshow'        NB. position and show window.
#+end_src

Okay so now we have a bunch of window driver calls to set up our window.

I covered most of this in my basic animation video, so I won't repeat it here.

The main thing that's new is that I've got multiple controls on the screen,
so I'm using the bin command to group them horizontally and vertically.

So now when I run this...

I get a blank window. There's no menu bar yet,
just space set aside for the palette and the canvas,
and then a little status bar you can barely
see down here at the bottom.

So now we need to tell it what to draw.

* viewmat again
#+begin_src j
require 'viewmat'
coinsert 'jviewmat jgl2'

vmcc =: verb define                       NB. invoke viewmat in a child control
  'pc cc img' =. y                        NB. usage: vmcc(parent;child;pixels)
  wd 'psel ',pc                           NB. select parent control
  glpaint [ 'rgb' vmcc_jviewmat_ img;cc   NB. blit the pixel data and repaint.
)
#+end_src

Now we import viewmat and define vmcc.

I did something close to this in the animation video.

The difference is that now, I also pass in the parent control name,
so we can select the window we're working with.

In my case, this presentation window is also running in J.

If you only have one window you don't need the psel step
but it's probably a good habit to get into.

Okay, so when I run this code
nothing happens on screen.
We just have some new definitions to work with.

* render "animation"
#+begin_src j
image =: 32 32 $ 0

render =: verb define
  vmcc 'gpw';'img';image
)

NB. call 'render' 10 times a second.
step =: render
sys_timer_z_ =: step_base_
wd 'timer 100'
#+end_src

So now let's actually call it.

gpw is the window name, img is the name of the canvas,
and image is the matrix we're going to edit.

And now I'm just doing the same thing from the animation video,
calling the render function every 100 miliseconds.

This is a bit wasteful since we're not really animating here, but I find it kind of convenient.

The alternative is to explicitly repaint each time we make a change.
That's probably the right way to do things if you're not going to be animating.
And so we'll do it that way when we draw the palette.

So when I run this...

There's our beautiful artwork!

* draw a grid
#+begin_src j
showgrid =: 1

render =: verb define
  vmcc 'gpw';'img';image
  if. showgrid do.
    'vw vh' =. glqwh glsel'img' [ 'ih iw' =. $ image
    glpen glrgb 255 255 255
    gllines <. 0.5+ (0, ], vw, ])"0 (vh%ih) * i.ih
    gllines <. 0.5+ (], 0, vh,~])"0 (vw%iw) * i.iw
  end.
)
#+end_src

Next up, I'm adding these lines to the render function.

The shape of the image gives us its height and width.
And glqwh means query width and height of the viewport.

If we divide the viewport into this many chunks we get the cell size,
and if we multiply that by this range, we get the y coordinate for each horizontal line.

So then this part maps each y coordinate to the start and end coordinates,
and gllines draws the whole array.

Then we do the same for vertical lines.
The only trick we want to put vh last in the list,
because it's a y coordinate
but if we want this to be a train,
the rightmost thing has to be verb.

I could have used zero colon on the right and put vh on the left,
or used vh doublequote zero to make it a verb, but instead
I just used the tilde to swap the order. There's no real reason
to do it one way or the other, as long as it works.

Anyway, if we run this, we get a grid.

...

You'll notice I put a conditional around this.
So let's add a keyboard shortcut to toggle this showgrid variable.

* keyboard shortcuts
#+begin_src j
NB. keyboard events are widget-specific, but we want same for img/pal
gpw_pal_char =: gpw_img_char =: verb define
  select. {. sysdata
    case. 'n' do. image =: 32 32 $ 0
    case. 'r' do. image =: ? 32 32 $ 2^24
    case. 'g' do. showgrid =: -. showgrid
  end.
)
#+end_src

Okay so each control has its own keyboard handler.

The naming scheme for all the control-specific event handlers
is parent name, child name, and then event name.

That's why I'm giving two names to the same verb.
The first name is the handler for the palette, and the second is for the canvas.

Pretty much every event sends its data to us by
populating a string named sysdata in the current locale.

So when it's a keyboard event, sysdata is just a string with
whatever the ascii character is for the key that got pressed.

You might ask what about control and alt and function keys,
but the answer is you actually can't trap those at the
child control level. As far as I know, those are handled
by the window as a whole.

I'm not actually sure how arrow keys are handled.
I'll have to investigate that at some point, but for now,
there are plenty of other keys to work with.

Okay, so this code should be pretty self explanatory
once you know the j primitives. I'll just run it and show each key.

From the bottom, up,

g toggles the grid. That dash and dot is the "not" sign. Or 1 minus y.

r fils the grid with random 24-bit colors (that's 8 bits each for red, green, and blue), which is what pretty much every graphics program uses.

Because we're redrawing 10 times a second, holding down r shows off the basic animation idea from the last video. That's kind of useless in a sprite editor, but it lets me demonstrate the last shortcut, which is that

'n' resets all the pixels back to zero, which is the color black.

It's n for new image.

Anyway, now that we have our grid, we want to be able to draw on it with the mouse.

In particular, we want to use the mouse coordinates to tell us which pixel in the image needs to change.

So the first challenge is to get the mouse coordinates.

* mouse coordinates
Let's show the mouse coordinates.
#+begin_src j
gpw_img_mmove =: verb define
  wd 'set sb setlabel text *', sysdata
)

#+end_src

Once again, we just define a function with the right name, and we get the event handler.

mmove handles mouse movement, and we only care about the canvas this time.

again, sysdata is a string with information about the event,
and this line just tells the window driver to set our
status bar label to whatever's in that string.

sb is just the name i gave to the status bar, and setlabel text is just one of the actions a status bar control can handle.

The asterisk is a special syntax that tells wd that the rest of the input we're sending is an argument to whatever command we just gave. Otherwise we'd have to put double quotes around it, and it would keep looking for more window driver commands afterward.

Anyway, when we run this,
and move the mouse over the canvas,
you can see the full string we get for mouse events.

Basically, it's the x y coordinates of the mouse
the width and height of the child control
and then a bunch of flags for which buttons
and modifier keys are pressed.

We'll use the flags a bit later, but for now all we care about are the coordinates.

We want to take these numbers
which are screen coordinates relative to the upper left corner
and map them to the array indices of our image.


* grid coordinates

#+begin_src j
gpw_img_mmove =: verb define
  wd 'set sb setlabel text *', ": whichbox cellsize''
)

cellsize =: verb define
  (glqwh glsel'img') % |.$ image
)

whichbox =: verb define                   NB. which cell is the mouse over?
  |. <. y %~ 2 {. ".sysdata               NB. (only works inside mouse events)
)

#+end_src

First in our mouse move handler, we replace sysdata with this expression.
It says evaluate the cellsize verb, pass the result to whichbox,
and then convert the result to a string.

cellsize is pretty much the same idea we used when drawing the grid.
query the width and height of the canvas
divide it by the shape of the image
but the shape is height and width, and we want width and height,
so reverse it first.

so now that becomes the y argument to whichbox,
which takes the sysdata string,
evalutes it to get an array of numbers
takes the first two numbers
and divides them by the cellsize
then round down
and then swap the order
because we want the answer to be an array index.

so let's run it...

And now you can see
i get coordinates in terms of grid cells,
when i move the mouse up and down
it's the first value that changes, rather than the second.

Okay, so now that we can map a mouse position to an array index,
we want to update the array whenever you press the mouse button.

* click to draw

#+begin_src j
gpw_img_mblup =: verb define
  NB. left click to draw on the image
  mousedraw whichbox cellsize''
)

mousedraw =: verb define
  NB. y is the (y,x) coordinates of the pixel to draw
  image =: 16bffffff (< y) } image
)
#+end_src

The event handler for mouse clicks is 'mblup'
for 'mouse button left up'.

whichbox cellsize'' is the same code from the last slide
except now instead of showing the array index in the status bar,
we're calling this mousedraw verb,

and mousedraw just amends the image array by placing the value for white at the index we gave it.

Amend is this right curly brace.
It's an adverb, which means it takes an argument on the left,
and produces a new verb that takes its x argument
(which is this hex number)
and sticks it into the right argument
at the given coordinates.

J is a functional language, so you don't normally edit arrays in place.
Syntactically, this says make a copy that has this change, and then
assign the copy back to the original variable.

In practice, J is usually smart enough to know that if the source and destination
are the some, it's safe to just modify the array in place behind the scenes.

Finally, this less-than sign says to box the coordinates we're passing in.
I'll talk about that in a minute, but first let's run this code.


...

And now when I click somewhere, I draw a white pixel. Hooray!


* boxing and amend

#+begin_src j
image =: 16bff6699 (4 28) } image   NB. Missing the '<'
#+end_src

Okay so here's the same basic code, without the less than sign to box the coordinates.

4 28 is this pixel here.

But when I run the code...

I get stripes!

Remember in J you're always dealing with entire arrays at once.

In this case, you're passing in an array of indices to modify.
So it's saying set item 4 and item 28 in the image to this value.
Well the items of a rank 2 array are its rows.
So, set all of row 4 and all of row 28 to the value.

Sometimes you actually want to specify multiple indices like this,
and sometimes you want to specify coordinates.

In J, the amend adverb covers both cases, and if you want to amend at depth
meaning you want coordinates rather than multiple indices, then the answer is to wrap it in a box.

* boxing and amend - example

#+begin_src j
image =: 16b6699ff (8 9; 30 30) } image
#+end_src

By the way, if you want multiple sets of coordinates, you can send an array of boxes.

That's what the semicolon verb is doing here.

(run)

There you go. Two blue pixels.

Okay, let's get back to our program.

Having to click each pixel individually is annoying, so let's make it draw continously as long as the mouse button is held down.

* drag to draw

#+begin_src j
gpw_img_mmove =: verb define
  wd 'set sb setlabel text *', ": whichbox cellsize''
  if. lmb'' do. gpw_img_mblup'' end.
)

lmb =: verb : '4 { ".sysdata'             NB. left mouse button

#+end_src

Okay so this is the mouse move handler again.
The first line is what we wrote earlier to draw the coordinates in the status bar.

But now, if the left mouse button is pressed, call the cilck handler.

How do we know? Well, it's just one of those flags that I mentioned in the sysdata array.
The left mouse button happens to be item four in that array.

Anyway, that's all it takes.

Let's run this...

And now we can draw!

But... There's a small problem, which is what happens when you drag off the side of the screen.

Turns out that when you drag, this control keeps giving you mouse events until you let go,
even if your mouse is out of bounds.

* bounds checking

#+begin_src j
inbounds =: dyad define
  *./ (x >: 0) *. x < y
)

mousedraw =: verb define
  NB. y is the (y,x) coordinates of the pixel to draw
  if. y inbounds $image do.
    image =: 16bffffff (< y) } image
  end.
)
#+end_src

Pretty easy fix. Just update our mousedraw verb with some bounds checking.

So the right argument to inbounds is the shape of the image, and the left argument is the index.

Basically, each element in the index has to be less than the size of that dimension
and greater than or equal to zero.

The asterisk-dot means and.

So this    (x >: 0 *. x < y)
gives us a single bounds check result bit for each separate dimension.
And then this inserts 'ands' them all together.
So at the end you get one bit that says whether all the coordinates are within bounds.

And with that change...

we can see the out of bounds coordinates change in the status bar
but we no longer get an error.

So now, on to the palette.

* the palette

#+begin_src j
NB. default palette (16-color vga text-mode palette)
pal =:      16b000000 16baa0000 16b00aa00 16baa5500
pal =: pal, 16b0000aa 16baa00aa 16b00aaaa 16baaaaaa
pal =: pal, 16b555555 16bff5555 16b55ff55 16bffff55
pal =: pal, 16b5555ff 16bff55ff 16b55ffff 16bffffff

gpw_pal_paint =: verb define
  vmcc 'gpw';'pal';,.pal           NB. ,. makes pal a 2d array
)
#+end_src

The palette is just a rank 1 array of colors.

I happened to pick a default palette that's near and dear to my heart -
these are the colors you had to work with for ansi art back in the 90's.

We need a rank 2 array if we want to use viewmat to draw it,
and the comma-dot verb makes each item in the palette into its own row
so it renders vertically.

Running this defines a handler for the paint event for the palette,
but because we don't have the palette hooked up to the timer,
nothing actually happens until I click on the window.

(click)

But there it is!


* draw with the pen
#+begin_src j
pen =: 2  NB. green. just for this slide

mousedraw =: verb define
  NB. y is the (y,x) coordinates of the pixel to draw
  if. y inbounds $image do.
    image =: (pen { pal) (< y) } image
  end.
)
#+end_src

Okay, so now we're defining a variable called pen to hold our drawing color.
It's an index into the palette.

Then we just update mousedraw to pull the color from the palette.

So if I run this, we should be drawing in green.

...

* click to set pen color
#+begin_src j
pal_cellsize =: (glqwh glsel 'pal') % 1,#pal

gpw_pal_mblup =: verb define
  NB. left click palette to set pen color
  glpaint glsel 'pal' [ pen =: {. whichbox pal_cellsize
)
#+end_src

Now let's make the palette clickable.

Clicking the palette sets the color.

This is nothing new. Calculate the cell size for the palette.

Since there's only one column, we only care about the y coordinate.

So if we run this, we should be able to draw in different colors.

...

This last bit calls glpaint to force the control to refresh.

That actually doesn't do anythnig yet, but the point is we want to draw some kind of marker here to indicate the active color.

So let's do that.

* indicate current color
#+begin_src j

pen =: <: # pal  NB. start with last color (white)

gpw_pal_paint =: verb define
  vmcc 'gpw';'pal';,.pal           NB. ,. makes pal a 2d array
  NB. draw a box around the current pen color:
  glbrush glrgba 0 0 0 0  [ h =. {: cellsize =. pal_cellsize
  glrect 3, (3+pen*h), _5 _5 + cellsize [ glpen 5 [ glrgb 0 0 0
  glrect 3, (3+pen*h), _5 _5 + cellsize [ glpen 1 [ glrgb 3 $ 255

  NB. black box around everything:
  glrect 0 0, (glqwh 'pal') [ glpen 1 [ glrgb 0 0 0
)
#+end_src

There's nothing special going on here. Just calling glrect to draw three boxes.
I draw both black and white boxes over the current color so you can see the cursor
no matter what color you click on.

And then just because the white kind of blends in on my monitor,
I draw a thin black box around the whole thing.

(run)

Again we have to click the window to trigger the repaint.

Okay. Now we can click and see our selection,
but it's annoying to keep moving the mouse back to the palette,
so let's let you move this cursor up and down with the mouse wheel.

* mouse wheel

#+begin_src j
NB. mouse wheel on either control rotates through palette
gpw_img_mwheel =: gpw_pal_mwheel =: verb define
  pen =: (#pal)|pen-*{:".sysdata NB. sign of last item is wheel dir
  glpaint glsel'pal'
)
#+end_src

Hopefully this is starting to make sense. It's just another event handler called mwheel.

You get the same array of mouse event numbers as the other mouse events.
The last one in the list gives you the change in the angle of the mouse wheel.

So the doublequote-colon parses the string, the curly-colon takes the last item.

For my mouse that tends to always be either 15 or negative 15.

But we only care about the direction, so asterisk gives us the sign.

So now we have a one or negative one, and we can subtract it from the pen number to move the cursor, because that's just how the directions turn out.

The pipe character is modulo, so if we hit negative one, it wraps around to the end, and if we go past the end, it wraps around to zero.

Then just repaint.

So run this...

And now the color changes with the mouse wheel.

* file menu
#+begin_src j
wd 'psel gpw'
wd 'menupop "&File"'                      NB. File menu
wd '  menu new  "&New"  "Ctrl+N"'
wd '  menu open "&Open" "Ctrl+O"'
wd '  menu save "&Save" "Ctrl+S"'
wd 'menupopz'
#+end_src

Next up is the file menu.

As soon as we run this, a menu bar will appear in the window.
It seems like you can add this at any time.

menupop starts a new menu, menupopz ends it.
You can nest those if you need submenus.

The menu command adds an new item to the menu.
Each menu item has a name, which will correspond to an event handler.
So here the names are lowercase new, open, and save.

The next column here is the text that shows up in the menu.
The Ampersands give you a hotkey you can press when the menu is open.

The last colum is a global hotkey, which you can handle at any point.
Remember I said the control keys are global to the window rather than a child control?
Well, here's one way you can set them.


* file /new new item
#+begin_src j
gpw_new_button =: verb define
  image =: ($image) $ 16bffffff                      NB. set to white
)
#+end_src

I already used the letter n to make the image black in the keypress handler,
so here's control-n to make it white.

The rule for naming menu handlers is to treat them as buttons, so it's window name, menu item name, and then the word button.

Run it...

And now it works either from the menu...

Or just by pressing control n.

* open / save
#+begin_src j
require 'png'

gpw_open_button =: verb define
  path =. wd 'mb open1 "Load a png file" filename "PNG (*.png)"'
  if. #path do. image =: readpng path end.
)

gpw_save_button =: verb define
  path =. wd 'mb save "Save image" filename "PNG (*.png)"'
  if. #path do. (image+255*2^24) writepng path end.
)
#+end_src

The Open and Save commands both send the mb message to the window driver.
MB is short for message box, and it just invokes a standard system dialog box.

Let's run this so you can see what it does...

The dialog box is modal, which means you can't do anything else until you pick a path or close the window.

If you close the dialog, you get an empty string back. Otherwise you get a path.

So if the length is zero, we do nothing, otherwise we pass it to these readpng and writepng functions, which I got from this `require 'png'` line.

One small trick here is that the png library is expecting four bytes per pixel. The last byte is an alpha channel, which just means you can specify a level of opacity. So when I write the file, I set that value to full opacity. Otherwise, when you open it in other programs, it winds up looking like an empty image.

Anyway, now we can load and save files...

Almost done here. The last thing is to right click a box in the palette to change the color.

* custom colors
#+begin_src j
gpw_pal_mbrup =: verb define
  pen =: {. whichbox {: pal_cellsize      NB. same as mblup: set pen
  rgb =: ": 256 256 256 #: pen { pal      NB. get 'r g b' string for old color
  if. #rgb =. wd'mb color ',rgb do.       NB. show system color picker
    c =. 256 #. ".rgb                     NB. turn new string into new color
    pal =: c pen } pal                    NB. update the palette...
  end.
  glpaint glsel 'pal'                     NB. ... and redraw it.

#+end_src

Right clicking is just 'mbrup' for mouse button right up.

Let's go ahead and run this, and then explain how it works.

How about we replace this blue with a different shade?

We set the pen just like a left click.

This hash-colon function is very useful. It's called antibase, and it lets you break a number down into digits in a particular base (or even a mix of bases). Well a byte is kind of like a digit in base 256, so this takes our color and breaks it into three bytes representing the red, green, and blue components.

Anyway, doublequote colon formats our three bytes as a space separated string in decimal, and then we pass that string to the color message box.

Again, it pops up the system color picker, and gives back either a new string with three numbers, or you close the window and get an empty string.

So if the result has a length, we do the inverse of what we just did: parse the string back into an array, and apply the base function (hash dot), which is almost but not quite the opposite of antibase, to get the new color.

So then we stick the new color back into the palette slot we originally clicked on, and then repaint the control.

 thanks for watching!

#+end_src

And there you have it: a very primitive sprite editor in J.
