* [9/9] scene progress
** DONE 2:15 0a-demo
- [X] drawing the first four is a bit out of sync
- [X] line of threes a bit weird
- [X] add some annotations when discussing the behavior in the middle

** DONE 0:22 0b-intro
** DONE 2:30 1-sandpiles
- [X] draw a nicer picture in gridpad
- [X] re-edit to show the sand falling off!
- [X] cut the talk about changes to gridpad
- [X] cut the talk about the palette
*** DONE record voice-over

Okay so we're going to make several sandpile
programs today and they're all extensions of
gridpad, the sprite editor I made in my last video.

Most of my videos focus on this rather unusual
programming language called J, and I tend to
explain every single line as I go along.

But, I thought with all pretty graphics,
/this/ video might be interesting to people
who don't necessarily care about J,
so I'm only going to explain the lines
that are specifically about sandpiles,
and I'll move everything else to a
separate code review episode for really
want to understand how it works.

So in that video, I'll explain how you can
inherit behavior between applications in J,
how I'm mapping the sandpile numbers back and forth to colors,
how to draw the fancy palette on the side,
and I'll also go into a lot more detail
on all the other code that you'll see on
your screen in the rest of this video.

** DONE 00:48 2-codegolf
   "number four" (long pause) "runs the sandpile..."
   cut "title here says golfed"
** DONE 00:36 3-sandpaint
*** DONE summarize the paint program
Sandpaint is the same as the modified gridpad
I was showing earlier,
but with a slightly bigger drawing area,
and some keyboard shortcuts for controlling the speed.

*** DONE cut out stuttering early in animation
*** DONE dub last line ("do some science")
** DONE 4a-sandpaper-intro
*** DONE move myself left to crop out my hand in the scene
*** DONE 10s: show sandpile paper graphic
*** DONE show benoit mandelbrot
*** DONE show quote from martin-gardner as text while i read
*** DONE cut mention of non-log spectral density charts
*** DONE actually play the noises, and cut out "if you played as a sound"
*** DONE show the spectral density charts
** DONE 4b-sandpaper
*** [12/12] hypothesis
**** DONE skip the keyboard handling stuff.. go directly to "the first concept"
**** DONE "out in nature" sounds like "not in nature"
**** DONE speed up animation for "still gets through"
**** DONE "infinite distances" drops the "S"
**** DONE say the name of the paper correctly. (introduction vs explanation. d'oh.)
**** DONE re-record the quote from the paper
**** DONE the trick is to start with a _____ ?? (fades out... now it fades in. ugh)
**** DONE "i'm melting" doesn't show up
**** DONE need music for the all-fours
**** DONE "less ones and twos"
**** DONE show the graphic from the paper with the dark areas filled in
**** DONE "let j do the wuh" (fades out)
*** [3/3] experiment
**** DONE add a "don't panic" message :)
**** DONE need a better cut to the sandpaper experiment.
     (maybe black screen with white text)
**** DONE show the plots
*** [2/2] results
**** DONE charts on the bottom -> "3 dimension__" (fades out)
**** DONE highlight the charts
** DONE 5-sandcalc:      8:00   mostly good. just a couple minor edits:
*** DONE 0:45 or so: "is two" still sounds terrible (now it's bad in the other direction)
*** DONE you start "with an array of four"
*** DONE "zeroes become fours"
*** DONE 0:50 plus sign was invented
*** DONE show a screenshot of the critical sandpile
*** DONE all i have to say about sandpile_
** DONE 6-close:     1:12
cover up my hand with background since it's getting keyed out
0:23

* DONE title cards
* DONE ending animation with links to other videos
* TODO credit all music
