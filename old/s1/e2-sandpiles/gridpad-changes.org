#+title: gridpad changes

gridpad.ijs was created as an application for the previous j talk video:

  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK2SazvCxM

a snapshot of the code after that video can hopefully be found here:

  https://github.com/tangentstorm/j-talks/blob/master/s1/e1-gridpad/gridpad-final.ijs

to re-use it as a library in the sandpile video, i made the following changes:

- use the 'gridpad' locale (which you are meant to ~coinsert~)

- renamed some things:
  - ~img~ control -> ~imgv~
  - ~pal~ control -> ~palv~
  - ~image~ -> ~img~
  - ~lmb~ -> ~mbl~ to match up with the ~wd~ convention
  - ~pal_cellsize~ -> ~palv_cellsize~  (also it's now a verb since the window creation is delayed)
  - ~cellsize~ -> ~imgv_cellsize~
  - ~mousedraw~ -> ~img_draw~
  - ~showgrid~ -> ~gpw_opt_showgrid~

- factored out a bunch of initialization options which you can override in your calling locale:

| ~gpo_title~     | window title                                |
| ~gpo_window~    | window options for wd  (eg 'nosize')        |
| ~gpo_init_xy~   | initial window position                     |
| ~gpo_timer~     | speed at which to set the timer             |
| ~gpo_palv_wh~   | width and height of palette view            |
| ~gpo_imgv_wh~   | width and height of image view              |
| ~gpo_statusbar~ | whether to add status bar                   |
| ~gpo_showgrid~  | whether to show the grid by default         |
| ~gpo_gridrgb~   | color of the gridlines                      |
| ~gpo_colorpick~ | whether to allow changing the palette       |
| ~gpo_viewmat~   | x arguments for viewmat (defaults to 'rgb') |
| ~gpo_menu~      | a string containing the wd menu definiton   |

- removed all keyboard events
- added 'view' menu with option to toggle grid
- timer is now sent through ~wd~'s ~ptimer~ command, so the tick handler is ~gpw_timer~
- added a do-nothing ~update~ verb that you can override ~render~ and ~update~ stages separately.
- the 'new' menu handler sets the image to all 0 instead of 16bffffff
- consolidated the character handler functions into single ~gpw_char~ so you can override in one place.
- ~gpw_render0~ and ~gpw_palv_paint0~ are aliases you can call from your own ~render~ and ~gpw_palv_paint~ routines, without having to mess with passing the right locale to vmcc.
- all routines that assign to ~img~ now explicitly call ~render~ in case the timer is set to 0
- add ~gpw_path~ to remember save location and added ~gpw_dir~ verb to get working directory
- add an empty ~to_rgb~ verb you can override to map an indexed palette to rgb on render.
- add an empty ~to_pal~ verb you can override to map (a)rgb back to an indexed palette on load.
- extracted ~to_argb~ verb from the save routine so you can override it.
- ~img_draw~ can now take a rank 2 array as the left argument to draw on that array instead of on ~img~
- added ~gpw~ verb to quickly set img, re-render, and bring window to the front.
