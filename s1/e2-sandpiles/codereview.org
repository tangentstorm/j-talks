#+title: code review: sandpiles

* TODO 0. intro
This is where all the tricks are revealed.
If you just want a magic show, see the other video.

* TODO 1. sandpiles
** TODO overview
** TODO changes to gridpad
** TODO inheritance in j
Now the way overriding and inheritance works in J is that
your code executes in a namespace called a locale,
and they're chained together so that if the interpreter
can't find the word it's looking for in the current locale,
it'll walk down the lookupe path until it either finds the
word or gives up.

So here I'm setting up three new locales and creating
an inheritance hierarchy descending from gridpad, which
looks like this:

# show image

Normally I'd put each of these pairs of lines at
the top of its own file, but that's just a convention,
and you can switch locales at any time.

So =cocurrent= is how you make that switch.
you're just telling it which locale you want to use.

=coinsert= takes the name of another locale and inserts it
at the start of the current locale's lookup path.

The 'co' prefix stands for 'class/object' and they're
the heart of J's object oriented programming setup.

If you want to break your whole application down into
classes and instantiate them, you can absolutely do that,
but classes and objects are also just one convention.

For this talk, we're doing something more like prototype
inheritance, and we'll just treat each application as one
object.

So gridpad is the prototype we're starting with,
sandpaint and sandcalc are the applications we're building,
and sandpiles is just a common place in the middle where
we can put things like colors and the simulation routine
that are used by both apps.

We can add stuff in any order, but I like to keep
something happening on the screen so I can see the effect
of my code, so let's start with sandpaint.
** TODO sandpiles window
** TODO sandpile colors

the numbers in the palette

contain the raw number of grains of sand for each square,
and then the =to_rgb= function maps whatever number happens to
be there to a color, and then if you load a png file
into the progam, =to_pal= maps these exact colors to the
corresponding number, and any other colors get mapped to 0.

I won't say too much about this code since you can see what it does.
I will point out that up here, we're using idot with one argument,
where it means range.

Then in =to_pal=, we use i. with a noun on the left, where it means
index of. It's a bit like how the minus sign can mean negative if
it's in front of a value, and subtraction if it's Pretty much every
primitive in J has two meanings like this.

So rgb idot some color finds the index of that color in the rgb list.
The png files are actually saved as argb though, so this bit on the end
is stripping off the alpha channel.

So it's the index of the color in the rgb list, modulo the length
of the list. If the thing you're looking for isn't in the list,
then you get back the length of the list as a not found value,
so if you take the result modulo the length, it maps unknown
to zero.

Then =to_rgb= is the same kind of thing, except you can have any amount
of sand in a square, and the colors represent entire ranges of numbers.
Capital idot with two arguments is interval index, and it also finds
the position in a list, but it expects the list to be sorted, and it
tells you where the thing on the right would go if you were going to
insert it.

Then we just min that with one less than the length of the list so
anything too big gets mapped to the last color. You should never
wind up with a negative number in the array, but if you did, capital
I dot would map it to zero since it's less than the
first entry in the palette.

Anyway, if we run this and click the window to make it repaint,
we have our colors.

** TODO palette labels

For-underscore-something is how you write an explicit loop.
Here n is the loop variable, and it gets assigned to each
item in pal. This also defines a temp variable
called n-underscore-index, which I alias and
use for some calculations.

Anyway, run this and click to force a repaint,
and now we're ready to start coding the sandpile rules.
** TODO approaching the rules

Appending at the next to top level is a builtin - that's comma dot, or stitch.
For behead and curtail, we just expliictly say rank 1, and the right identity
function here is just acting as a separator so the one and zero don't turn
into an array.

** TODO settle
** TODO golfed version
#+begin_src j

NB. my original golfed version
s=:(+[:(+/@(1&|:@f@|:,f)-4&*)3&<)^:_

#+end_src

* TODO 2. sandpaint
** sandpaint window
** DONE time control

In the basic animation videos, I used the window driver's timer command.
It turns out if you use ptimer instead, you can set a timer
just for one window, and it sends you an event on each tick.

* TODO 3. sandpaper

* TODO 4. sandcalc
