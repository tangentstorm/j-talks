* what value am i trying to provide? (what constraints overcome?)

** graphical ui (fnarbmlyx+godot)
- make it easier to animate and visualize ideas.

** j-kvm/ui
- lower the cost of building simple widgets.
- provide the mainloop/shell for applications.

** portable environment (building on b4 virtual machine)
- allows the toolset to work atop many languages/environments.
- give students a common starting point for learning.

** ampheck (specification language with proofs)
- be able to derive programs from specifications
  - get correct results
  - get them more quickly (especially w/stackwise ui)

** stackwise
- dramatically lower the cost of writing useful software,
  by making it easier to focus on important tasks that actually
  make a difference.

** narrative trail
- build a small-but-complete computing system from the ground up,
  that can fit in a single user's head, and provide instructions
  for acuiring an understanding of that system, via narrative
  programming.

- provide interesting content to help build an audience on my
  blog, youtube channel, etc.
