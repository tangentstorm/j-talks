Define the neighbours of a graph's vertex, N(v) as the set of all vertices adjacent to v. 
Suppose that a simple graph has an odd vertex. Show that there exist two vertices a, b such that |N(a) intersect N(b)| is even.

type:  graph of T = { V : Set of T,  E : Set of (V,V) }

proof by induction on graph G

  - base case: graph "x -- y" (smallest graph with an odd vertex)
    =>  a=x, b=y so |N a ∩ N a| = 0
  - induction on graph G
    assume ∃ a, b:T where |N a ∩ N b| is even
    assume ∃ o:T where o is odd vertex (i.e, | N o | is odd)
    split on possible construction steps:
      case: add vertex => ok   # 'ok' means nothing changes, so a'=a, b'=b
      case: add edge {p,q}
        if {p,q} ∩ {a,b} = {} => ok
        elif {p,q} = {a,b}:  -- new edge between a,b
           => ok # nothing changes to (N a ∩ N b) because N is not reflexive
        else: # new neighbor added to one of {a,b}
           let {v} = {p,q} ∩ {a,b} -- the old vertex v ∈ {a,b}
           let {u} = {a,b} - {v}   -- whichever of {a,b} is not v
           let {w} = {p,q} - {v}   -- the new neighbor w ∉ {a,b}
           if {u,w} ∉ G.E: => ok  # |N v| +=1 but |N v ∩ N u| is unchanged
           else: # {u,w} ∈ G.E:
             # w is now a neighbor to both, so |N v ∩ N u| +=1
             # so we need to find a different pair.


      => nothing changes

       # sorry
    - case: new edge {p,q} where p in {a,b} and q not in {a,b}
       # sorry
