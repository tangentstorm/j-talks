* "user stories"
You can write software just for fun, or to learn.
You can write software because someone paid you to.

But if you want to write software that makes a difference
in the world, you should probably try to think in terms
of the value you want to bring.

Specifically, consider Eli Goldratt's questions:

  - what will this change allow the user to do?
  - what obstacle or constraint will it lift?
  - what behaviors currently exist to work around that constraint?
  - how must those behaviors change now that the constraint has been lifted?

Apply these questions recursively, all the way down to the feature level.
