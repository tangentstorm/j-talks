if. then. else.

these three words from your favorite programming language
can be used to simplify any statement in propositional
logic down to a truth table.

 here's an example with three variables.

pick one variable, and make two copies of the expression.

we'll branch on that variable.

IF that variable is true
THEN we can replace it with the symbol for true
ELSE we replace it with false.

Then simplify the expression.

Do the same with the next variable.

And the next.

Eventually, you'll have nothing but constants,
and that's your truth table.

Anyway, if you ever need a brute force way to
solve a boolean expression

just remember the magic words



<loop>

[add context in a comment:
   This process is called Shannon decomposition after
   Claude Shannon, although the idea goes back at least
   as far as Boole. ]
