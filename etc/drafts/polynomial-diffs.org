#+begin_src j

  s =. 2 3 5 p. i. 20                NB. some sequence
  d =. ,.(2-~/\])&.>^:(<5) <s        NB. repeat differences
  r =. 1 + 1 i.~ ({.*./@:=}.) S:0 d  NB. 1st row where all same (rank of poly)
  c =. {. S:0 r {. d                 NB. the coefficients
  p%f

#+end_src


you do a bunch of diffs and then you get something like...

well you get this infinite sum of falling powers over factorials,
with the first items of each row of diffs as coefficients.

this makes a ("maclauren series?")



#+begin_src j
  p =. (1,[:*/\[-i.@<:)              NB. falling powers of y
  f =. !i.#p                         NB. n! for i.r-1
#+end_src


but to get the polynomial from this, you have to
turn this into an expression of n symbolically.
