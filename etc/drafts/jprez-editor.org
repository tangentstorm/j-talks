welcome to the ridiculously early j morning show

I lost the first few minutes of this one due to some kind of setup mistake
but you didn't miss much.

Basically, jprez has this idea of slides, and each slide can
contain j code that shows up in a text editor on the screen.

But at this point in time, it's just being manually drawn to
the screen rather than being part of a well-defined ui widget.

So this episode is about factoring out a real editor widget.

* existing editor code
describe the current code

* multi-line editor plan
* extract jedit.ijs
* add some text to screenplay
* jcodeeditor extends UIList
* extract syntaxline from repl to re-use in editor
* =of_self=
* (jedit) render the editor cursor
