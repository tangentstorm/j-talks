so you have random events
but not completely random
say you're rolling a normal six-sided die
imagine you made a pie chart.
you would expect that over time you'd see
six equally sized slices.

this is white noise.

suppose we label three sides of the die 1,2,3 as normal, but then -1,-2,-3 moves,
and then used it to move a token up or down.

you'd expect a normal distribution of final positions after n moves, clustered around the center.



so if you look at the indivdiual movements, you'd expect 
you'd expect a normal distribution.
