* generating a deck

: deck=:,{'23456789TJQKA';'cdhs'
: |: 13 4 $ deck

* shuffle and deal

this shuffles any array:

: ({~[:?~#)

* do we need the array?
maybe easier to just deal with the numbers:

:  5{.?~52

** mapping ints->cards

use antibase

:  13 4 #: i. 52

and to go the other way:

: 13 4 #. 12 3 NB. maps back to 51

* solitaire
- piles of cards
- face up vs face down

operations:
- draw from deck
- place card on "normal" pile
  - place any king on blank pile
    - otherwise, need (rank-1) to add to work pile
- place card on "final" pile
  - an ace can go on any free slot
  - otherwise, must have same suit, and rank(new) must be rank(top)+1


* poker hands
these are just patterns someone saw in the cards
some patterns are common, some are rare.
some ranks are equally common but stronger because of the ranks.
(aces and kings aren't any rarer than twos and threes)

the patterns:
- duplicate cards (pairs, trips, quads)
- 5 cards of one suit
- 5 cards in sequence
- straight+flush
