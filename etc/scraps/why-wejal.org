It is almost trivial these days to write code that is portable between
operating systems, but it is next to impossible to write code that is
portable between applications or programming environments.

One solution is microservices, where you have 15 interpreters running
at the same time and all talking to each other. It's not a bad
situation, but sometimes I just want a little library that has all my
stuff in it no matter which language I happen to be working in.

So, how about a little tiny language you can take with you everywhere?
