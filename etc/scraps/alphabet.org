wanted to generate a random base-36 number, which meant getting the characters 0..=9 and a..=z

k version (using ok):
: a@,/((a:`c$'!256)?"0a")+!:'10 26

j version (simple):
: a.{~;(a.i.'0a')(+i.)&.>10 26

j version (complicated by boxes)
: a.{~;((i.10);i.26)+L:0;/'0a'i.~a.

k would be much shorter if there were an inverse for `c$x
(maybe I just don't know it?)

j is more complicated because it needs the ranks to match.
