#+title: what makes videos satisfying to watch?

- simple, step by step
- usually physical
- motion/transformation
- sense of completion
- illusion that "i could do that" (makes it look easy)

- you see progress along the way
- you can anticipate where it's going
  (reminds me of [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIuUxFc8dB4&t=10s][this lego video]] ... it's kind of boring at first, not obvious why you're watching... until you get to the payoff)
  "wait for it" videos suck (in my opnion) for this same reason.

* can a programming video be satisfying?
- often the interesting stuff is happening in the programmer's imagination
- showing step by step REPL transformations gives some sense of the feeling
- apl/j/k feel especially "satisfying" because they're so concise
- but it might be better to show the data and flow transformations rather than just the code
