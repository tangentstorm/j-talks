*first* import the raw media into davinci, to get the frame rate for the project set up right.

export from descript as adobe premiere xml.
if necessary, change filenames in the exported xml in a text editor.

then "import timeline" in the davinci project.
it seems to import the stereo audio as mono, so:
  - select all clips in the timline
  - right click and change the clip attributes
  - change the audio track to stereo
