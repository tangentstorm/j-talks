#+title: boolean simplification

# (working from random AST 322 from fnarbmlyx)
# leftmost part looks like:

#+begin_src j
(((0 *. x1) *. 0) ~: (x0 ~: ((0 +. 1) *. x2))) NB. ...
#+end_src

to simplify, we walk the twigs from left to right,
and look for situations where the twigs can be simplified.

possibilities for twig = f(x,y)

  x = 0
  x = 1
  y = 0
  y = 1
  x = y
  x = -.y
  x = -.e
  y = -.e
  x > y (x,y constant)... mostly asthetic but might help with caching/normalization
