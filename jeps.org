#+title: j enhancement proposals
(suggest these on github:jsoftware/jsource)

* DONE {.@E. special form (string "startswith") .. also &.|. for endswith
https://github.com/jsoftware/jsource/issues/28

* TODO suggest  =..= as a statement separator

* TODO suggest 'nesting counter' in =load= for handling name==main:
best i have so far is this:
#+begin_src j
{{ y }}^:('repl.ijs' {.@E.&.|. >{.}.ARGV)'')
#+end_src
have a counter called =loading= incremented and decremented by =load=
so that we can just test for
: {{ 'startup code' }}^:ifmain

* TODO suggest nested namespaces / =::= in names for namespaces?
