#+TITLE: kanban for rejms (the ridiculously early j morning show)
#+TODO: BUG TODO | DONE

* inbox (for triage)
- ^c should be copy, not "break"
- also ^c / in line-editor should not break whole application
- ctrl-space should not break whole application
- =render_UiListWidget_= could use some golfing
- fill in old git tags for older episodes
- script to automate these tags ??

* current sprint
** DONE "focus color" for cursors in list, edit, repl          :feature:jprez:jkvm:
** BUG inserting repl->script mis-manages start state          :bug:jprez:

** TODO [#A] backspace key in editor
** TODO [#A] tie repl to the command history                   :jrepl:
Pressing up or down should let you navigate the input history.
This history is provided by worlds.ijs.

** TODO support the escape codes to toggle wrapping            :jkvm:
** TODO make sure R=:0 in =render__repl= (in update, copy R from ed)

* backlog
** TODO stop/ restart macros during playback
important because it can take a long time while you're using jprez
also you don't want other keys to fire the macro or it'll screw up
** TODO cut, copy, paste                                       :jkvm:edit:

** TODO [#B] alt-backspace to delete previous word             :jkvm:edit:
** TODO [#B] repl animations can also push input to the editor buffer :jprez:lsed:
- maybe any assignment or load/import goes to the editor buffer by default?
** TODO [#B] store lsed state (visible, buffer, cursor) in each world :jprez:lsed:
** TODO [#B] make worlds optional                              :jrepl:
Some people will just prefer a regular repl.

** TODO [#B] set initial state of editor for slide             :jprez:lsed:
Ex: we want to show complete settle code /before/ we derive it.
- parse block names from org-mode ... /or/ just use headlines?
** TODO [#B] command to insert a line from repl into the buffer at position x :jprez:lsed:
** TODO [#B] command to evaluate the editor in the repl        :jprez:lsed:
- probably don't want to dump the whole buffer
- maybe say '<<evaluated x lines...>>' in the repl
** TODO [#B] draw the editor cursor(s)                         :jprez:lsed:
** TODO [#B] draw selection                                    :jprez:lsed:
** TODO [#B] save state of the editor/slide at each step       :jprez:lsed:

** TODO [#B] make keybindings table-driven (so people can choose which keys they use for input) :jkvm:
** TODO [#B] speed up the escape code parsers (vputs, onkey)   :jkvm:
:PROPERTIES:
:Effort:   2d
:END:
** TODO [#C] test that the macro actually produces the next line of code in the script.
examples: manually edited macros might break.
using "future" completion history is not allowed.
** TODO [#C] detect and "bake" usage of "future command line history" :jprez:
this when you have a full future history from loading a presentation,
and you use that history to complete a line in the past.
This makes no sense from a narrative point of view.
** TODO [#C] clear "future" worlds on input                    :jprez:
** TODO [#C] recalculate all worlds                            :jprez:
** TODO [#C] show world for line, with content?                :jrepl:debug:

:PROPERTIES:
:Effort:   3d
:END:
** TODO [#C] decide whether curs 0 should be part of loop_kvm_, and if so, how to use cursors?
maybe this is just a flag.

** TODO add word-wrap mode
** TODO extract UiComponent from UiApp (component=widget+container) (??)
have a list of children and auto-provide the ability to draw all of them with extra code.
(probably can factor this out of ui/app.ijs)

***** TODO redraw the changes:
generate list of attributes of the changed cells.
ideally you'd have rank 2 list: fg and bg.
turn it into 2 boxes.

anywhere the color changes from box to box, you issue a color change,
otherwise ''.

likewise, for the coordinates, if they're right next to each other,
you don't need to issue a cursor move
**** TODO [#9] representing the video buffer more compactly
***** option 2: 32 bits per cell
- 13 bit unicode char
- 23 bits left over for bold/italic/underline
- 256 fg, bg colors

The trick to packing the unicode would
be to use a code page prefix, and only
allow a fixed number of code pages on
the screen at one time. (like 64 or something)

***** dealing with multi-codepoint characters?
we could also track the individual characters
we need. this might be useful because a cell on
the screen might be filled with multiple unicode cells.

#+begin_src j
u:16ba00+_2 dfh\'2a281c3e2c40'
ਪਨਜਾਬੀ
punjabi ... seems like each vowel takes a half-space
#+end_src

***** rank 1 or 2?
2d seems natural but operations are simpler in 1d
and we can just apply the necessary calculations to
map index positions to coordinates after we've
selected for differences

for a black and white matrix this is fine.
but we can have true color now.
** TODO editor file commands

** [4/16] token editor
*** TODO connect buffer editor to the slide
*** DONE make the editor into a widget
*** DONE ability to insert / edit plain text lines
**** DONE fix bug that deleted blank lines on save
org parser was deleting lines matching the slide (incl. blanks)
rather than just extracting the range.
**** DONE [3/3] keys O/o to start blank lines before/after
***** DONE use the 'insert' command from the editor widget
***** DONE verb to invoke line editor

*** TODO show each input lines input number in the text itself =: label_324.= or something
*** TODO record in the repl
*** TODO add special pop-up editor for editor macro lines.
*** TODO run macro lines internally when rendering, and verify correctness:
- next line must be a : line
- it must match the contents of the buffer after macro is run
*** TODO button to play an animation in place in the repl
*** TODO toggle focus of the widget with tab
*** TODO separate ui widgets for each level
**** TODO UiWordEd - word editor (string editor)
**** TODO UiLineEd - line editor (lines of tokens)

*** TODO [0/3] draw editor widget instead of a 'slide'
**** TODO make a CodeEdit class
- not in kvm unless i want to introduce jlex
**** TODO like Uilist, draw the visible buffer
**** TODO override the item-drawing verb so it highlights syntax
*** TODO [0/7] handle editor keyboard events

** [4/4] macro timing
*** DONE record and quantize keystroke timestamps
*** DONE encode timing in the macros itself
*** DONE [7/7] make macro animations asynchronous
(get them out of the while loop)

- [X] each widget needs an 'update' verb and an 'A' flag for whether it's active/animated.
- [X] update app should call update on every active widget on each tick, *before* it re-renders.
- [X] implement step ( just render @ update )
- [X] main loop should call app step instead of render.
- [X] argument to step should be the time delta since last step (j-kvm.ijs)
- [X] editor needs a flag/mode that indicates it's playing (maybe the A flag does this)
- [X] editor's update method should play the next character in the macro if it's animating.

*** DONE allow speed control per keystroke in the editor.
initially got this for free because it pauses after each keystroke

** [4/4] screenplay editor ui
*** DONE [3/3] implement a scrolling list widget
**** DONE visible range
**** DONE current highlight
**** DONE scroll
*** DONE show slides and steps in separate panes at bottom
*** DONE roundtrip to/from org-mode
*** DONE make kvm a library so syndir can import it
** [6/6] extract repl widget
*** DONE add history widget to repl
*** DONE implement solution for composite widgets
*** DONE allow widgets to draw and blit themselves to current terminal
*** DONE implement blit for vt
*** DONE make repl a composite widget
*** DONE draw history whether it's part of MJE or not
** previously
*** DONE finish parser for xterm color codes (vputs)
*** DONE widgetize repl history
*** DONE evaluate and show output
*** DONE implement ^K -> clear to end of line (d$ in vim?)
*** DONE don't hardcode the script path
*** DONE 'pre-render' the repl interactions for all slides
- history can just be the list of lines on the screen
- at each step, store which one is the bottom-most on screen.
- then to render, take a window of lines the same size as the terminal
- for each input there should/could also be an animation of how we arrived at it
*** DONE implement 'worlds' so I can track the state of the system at each point
*** DONE pre-determine the height of the repl window (=H_REPL=) for the presentation.
*** DONE use an in-world variable to track the state of the editor
*** DONE parse repl inputs from the org file
- lines starting with ': . ' are editor animations (macros)
- lines starting with ':' are repl input
- If a editor animaiton precedes the repl input, it should be treated as a derivation of the input, and an alarm should be triggered if it doesn't actually produce the expected input.
(this might happen if the editor macro modifies previous inputs and the input history changes due to modifying the narrative)
*** DONE handle local definitions
I see three alternatives:
  - [X] rewrite the code before it is evaluated (replace =. with =:)
  - execute the code in a separate j process
  - execute the code as part of an immex expression
*** DONE execute every line starting with ':' (but not ': .') on load
*** DONE execute each line using the world concept
*** DONE append output to the echo history
*** DONE track the repl history length at each step (before and after)
*** DONE when navigating to a step, render the repl in its 'before' state
*** DONE map each step in the slide to a world
*** DONE handle box-drawing characters
*** DONE rewrite special names

** ep-10: repl recorder
*** DONE insert new commands into screenplay
*** DONE insert keylog macro into screenplay
*** DONE clear macro after each input
** ep-11: macro playback in repl
*** bugs
**** DONE fix ctrl-o so it re-opens the file
**** DONE bug: history is messed up when you press ctrl-o
(needed to fix =init_world_=)
**** DONE bug: text added from repl gets discarded
(fix was to use =insline= instead of =ins__cmd=)
**** DONE do not show macros in the repl
(fix was change to =new_repl_line=)
**** DONE fix the right side of outline so that it scrolls
height (H)  was just set wrong
**** DONE =goz_UiList_= does not scroll correctly (cursor hidden when entering from bottom)
fixed by adding bounds checking to =goz=

*** features
**** DONE get simple macro playback working (using empty start state for now)
- Play macro when cmd cursor is on macro and you press 'N'.
**** DONE track the mark/selection on each line as we load (part of repl state)
- maybe answer here is to have UiEditWidget produce and consume a state memo

**** DONE play macros (without pauses) when loading and keep start states for each line
- =tmp= is temporary editor object (no need to render)
- set =KPS__tmp= to _ for infinite speed
- set =TSV__tmp= to 0 to turn off random variation
- call =do__tmp= with the macro
- just call =update_tmp 1= until =A__tmp= is 0
- state for next iteration is =B__tmp=
- save start states in =olr=

**** DONE play macros from the line's starting state when 'N' is pressed
